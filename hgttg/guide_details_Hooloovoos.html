<p>
It is difficult for a biped to have <a href="guide_details_sex.html">sex</a>
 with a Hooloovoo, as a Hooloovoo
is but a superintelligent shade of the color blue.  However, it can be
done with a little effort.  The only one to devise pleasure from this,
however, is the Hooloovoo, which sometimes sneaks onto bipeds and 
attaches itself to the male.  This may be the origin of the phrase 
"blue balls", but the author refuses to speculate on that possibility.
