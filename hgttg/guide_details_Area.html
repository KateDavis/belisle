Area - Infinite
<p>
Infinite : Bigger than the biggest thing ever and then some.
Much bigger than that in fact, really amazingly immense, a
totally stunning size, real "wow, that's big," time.  Infinity
is just so big that by comparison, bigness itself looks really
titchy.  Gigantic multiplied by staggeringly huge is the sort
of concept we're trying to get across here.
