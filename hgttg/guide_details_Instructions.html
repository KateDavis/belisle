<p>
The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, (VAX/VMS Version,) allows for
the finding of information that you don't really know where to look
for.   For instance, if you want to look up the Vreon Bird, but you
don't know what planet it lives on (Altragarvus VI) you would type:
<p>
* Vreon Bird
<p>
If you type a request for a topic and it doesn't appear,  you might
have to go down a couple of levels, like this:
<p>
* * * Towels
<p>
  This would bring up the entry DRACONIS, sub-entry ALPHA DRACONIS, 
sub-sub entry MINERAL BATHS,  and finally sub-sub-sub entry TOWELS.

If you want to become a contributing writer for the Guide, you must
inform the Chief Editor at Megadodo Publications on Ursa Minor Beta
in the Hitchhiker's Building.  Or mail him a message at the account
CCSUNIV001.
