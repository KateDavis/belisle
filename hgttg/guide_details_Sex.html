There's a lot of this going around the Universe, although it doesn't
really exist. (See UNIVERSE - SURVIVAL - SEX.)
<p>
There are different methods of having sex, depending on your biological

an Arenputt,  you'll have offspring which is neither a superintelligent
shade of the color blue, nor a semi-intelligent shade of the color red,
but an idiotic shade of the color purple.

Sex is hereditary: If your parents didn't have it, chances are that you
won't either.

Well, in fact there is an awful lot of this, largely because of the
total lack of money, trade, banks, art or anything else that might
keep all the nonexistent people of the Universe occupied.

However, it is not worth embarking on a long discussion of it now
because it really is terribly complicated.  For further information
see GUIDE Chapters seven, nine, ten, eleven, fourteen, sixteen,
seventeen, nineteen, twenty-one to eighty-four inclusive, and in fact
most of the rest of the Guide.
