<a name="Inhabitants.html"><h2> Inhabitants</h2></a>
<p>
The Belcerebon people of <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/19970804110827/http://www.connix.com/%7Eakricci/hgttg/guide_details_Kakrafoon.html">Kakrafoon</a> 
used to cause great resentment
and insecurity among neighboring races by being one of the most
enlightened, accomplished and, above all, quiet civilizations in
the Galaxy.
</p><p>
As a punishment for this behavior, which was held to be offensively
self-righteous and provocative, a Galactic Tribunal inflicted on them
that most cruel of all social diseases, telepathy.  Consequently, in
order to prevent themselves broadcasting every slightest thought that
crosses their minds to everyone within a five-mile radius, they now
have to talk very loudly and continuously about the weather, their little 
aches and pains, the match this afternoon and what a noisy place Kakrafoon 
has suddenly become.
</p><p>
Another method of temporarily blotting out their minds is to play
host to a <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/19970804110827/http://www.connix.com/%7Eakricci/hgttg/guide_details_DisasterArea.html"> Disaster Area</a> concert.
</p><p>
It was just this sort of thing that, in a strange fit of justice, not
only removed their telepathic ability once and for all, but changed
the once-desert world of Kakrafoon into a garden paradise.
