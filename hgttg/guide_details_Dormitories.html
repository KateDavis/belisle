Dormitories ("dorms") are a place on college grounds where the above
mentioned activities, fun, sex, and parties, are allowed to happen
on a twenty-four-hour-a-day basis.  The subversives contend, however,
that dormitories are places in which the students sleep, but it is well
known that it is difficult, if not impossible, to sleep while someone
else is having fun.
