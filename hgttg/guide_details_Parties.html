<a name="Parties.html"><h2> Parties</h2></a>
A gathering intended to provide the participants with fun of one sort
or another.  A party will usually result in damage to furniture, the
building in which it is held, several people's livers, and/or someone's
virginity.  However, there is seldom permanent damage unless the 
sponsor of the party (usually called the host) serves
<a href="guide_details_GargleBlaster.html">Pan Galactic Gargle Blasters</a> or
has the lack of foresight to invite Zaphod Beeblebrox.
