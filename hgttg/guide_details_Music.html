It seems that every type of race known to the galaxy has a form of music.
And, just as differences exist among the races, so do their forms of music
differ. For example, the V'lagian musical favorite consists of rubbing
small green frog-like animals against trees with rough barks, thus producing
an almost nerve-shattering scream (The V'lagians find this sound very
pleasing. In fact, so much so that their world is now all but extinct of
the small green frog-like creatures, and they have to import them.)
