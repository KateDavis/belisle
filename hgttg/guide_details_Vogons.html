<p>
Billions of years ago when the Vogons had first crawled out of the
sluggish primeval seas of Vogsphere, and had lain panting and heaving
on the planet's virgin shores...when the first rays of the bright
young Vogsol sun had shone across them that morning, it was as if the 
forces of evolution had simply given up on them there and then, had
turned aside in disgust and written them off as an ugly and unfortunate 
mistake.  They never evolved again: they should never have survived.
<p>
The fact that they did is some kind of tribute to the thick-willed
slug-brained stubbornness of these creatures.  "Evolution?" they
said to themselves, "Who needs it?" and what nature refused to do for
them they simply did without until such time as they were able to
rectify the gross anatomical inconveniences with surgery.
<p>
Meanwhile, the natural forces on the planet Vogsphere had been
working overtime to make up for their earlier blunder.  They
brought forth scintillating jeweled scuttling crabs, which the
Vogons ate, smashing their shells with iron mallets; tall aspiring
trees of breathtaking slenderness and color which the Vogons cut
down and burned the crabmeat with; elegant gazellelike creatures
with silken coats and dewy eyes which the Vogons would catch and 
sit on.  They were no use as transport because their backs would
snap instantly, but the Vogons sat on them anyway.
<p>
Thus the planet Vogsphere whiled away the unhappy millennia until the
Vogons suddenly discovered the principles of interstellar travel.
Within a few short Vog years every last Vogon had migrated to the 
Megabrantis cluster, the political hub of the Galaxy, and now
formed the immensely powerful backbone of the Galactic Civil Service.
They have attempted to acquire learning, they have attempted to 
acquire style and social graces, but in most respects the modern 
Vogon is little different from his primitive forebears.  Every
year they import twenty-seven thousand scintillating jeweled
scuttling crabs from their native planet and while away a happy
drunken night smashing them to bits with iron mallets.
<p>
The only race ever to derive any pleasure from mating with Vogons are
other Vogons.  For any other race, the experience can be rated up there
with going through a supernova unprotected, trying to get the Galactic
Civil Service to accept a change of address, or listening to Vogon poetry.
