<p>
The fabulously beautiful planet Bethselamin is now so worried about
the cumulative erosion by ten billion visiting tourists a year that
any net imbalance between the amount you eat and the amount you

when you leave: so every time you go to the lavatory there it is
vitally important to get a receipt.
