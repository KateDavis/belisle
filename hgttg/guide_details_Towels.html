<p>
A towel is about the most massively useful thing an interstellar
hitchhiker can have.  Partly it has great practical value.  You
can wrap it around you for warmth as you bound across the cold
moons of Jaglan Beta; you can lie on it on the brilliant marble-sanded
beaches of Santraginus V, inhaling the heady sea vapors;
you can sleep under it beneath the stars which shine so redly on
the desert world of Kakrafoon; use it to sail a miniraft down the
slow heavy River Moth; wet it for use in hand-to-hand combat;
wrap it round your head to ward off noxious fumes or avoid the 
gaze of the 
<a href="guide_details_BugblatterBeast.html"> Ravenous Bugblatter Beast of Traal </a>
(a mind-bogglingly
stupid animal, it assumes that if you can't see it, it can't see
you - daft as a brush, but very very ravenous); you can wave your
towel in emergencies as a distress signal, and of course dry 
yourself off with it if it still seems to be clean enough.
<p>
  More importantly, a towel has immense psychological value.  For
some reason, if a strag (nonhitchhiker) discovers that a hitchhiker
has his towel with him, he will automatically assume that he is also 
in possession of a toothbrush, washcloth, soap, tin of biscuits,
flask, compass, map, ball of string, gnat spray, wet-weather gear,
space suit etc., etc.  Furthermore, the strag will then happily
lend the hitchhiker any of these or a dozen other items that the
hitchhiker might accidentally have "lost".  What the strag will
think is that any man who can hitch the length and breadth of the
Galaxy, rough it, slum it, struggle against terrible odds, win through
and still know where his towel is, is clearly a man to be reckoned 
with.
<p>
Hence a phrase that has passed into hitchhiking slang, as in
"Hey, you sass that hoopy Ford Prefect?  There's a frood who really
knows where his towel is." (Sass: know, be aware of, meet, have 
<a href="guide_details_sex.html">sex</a>  
with;  hoopy: really together guy; frood: really amazingly together 
guy.)
<p>
If you ARE a silicon-based creature, and you do happen to bathe
in the hot springs on Alpha Draconis III, be sure to bring your
own towel.
