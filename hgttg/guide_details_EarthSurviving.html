Get a job as a cabdriver immediately.  A cabdriver's job is to
drive people anywhere they want to go in big yellow machines
called taxis.  Don't worry if you don't know how the machine

geography or indeed the basic physics of the area, and have
large green antennae growing out of your head.  Believe me, this
is the best way of staying inconspicuous.

yet achieved.
