<a name="money.html"><h2> Money</h2></a>
Monetary units - none.
<p>
In fact there are three freely convertible currencies in the
Galaxy, but none of them count.  The Altairian Dollar has
recently collapsed, the Flanian Pobble bead is only exchangeable
for other Flanian Pobble Beads, and the Triganic Pu has its own
very special problems.  Its exchange rate of eight Ningis to
one Pu is simple enough, but since a Ningi is a rubber coin six
thousand eight hundred miles along each side, no one has ever
collected enough to own one Pu.  Ningis are not negotiable
currency, because the Galactibanks refuse to deal in fiddling
small change.  From this basic premise it is very simple to
prove that the Galactibanks are also the product of a deranged
imagination.
