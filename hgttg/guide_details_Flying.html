<p>
There is an art, or rather a knack to flying.  The knack lies in
learning how to throw yourself at the ground and miss.
</p><p>
Pick a nice day and try it.
</p><p>
All it requires is the ability to throw yourself forward with all
your weight, and the willingness not to mind that it's going to hurt.
</p><p>
That is, it's going to hurt if you fail to miss the ground.
</p><p>
Most people fail to miss the ground, and if they are really trying
properly, the likelihood is that they will fail to miss it fairly
hard.
</p><p>
Clearly, it is this second part, the missing, which presents the
difficulties.
</p><p>
One problem is that you have to miss the ground accidentally.  It's
no good deliberately intending to miss the ground because you won't.
You have to have your attention suddenly distracted by something else
when you're halfway there, so that you are no longer thinking about 
falling, or about the ground, or about the how much it's going to hurt
if you fail to miss it.
</p><p>
It is notoriously difficult to prize your attention away from these
three things during the split second you have at your disposal.
Hence most people's failure, and their eventual disillusionment
with this exhilarating and spectacular sport.
</p><p>
If, however, you are lucky enough to have your attention momentarily
distracted at the crucial moment by, say, a gorgeous pair of legs
(tentacles, pseudopodia, according to phylum and/or personal 
inclination) or a bomb going off in your vicinity, or by suddenly
spotting an extremely rare species of beetle crawling along a nearby
twig, then in your astonishment you will miss the ground completely
and remain bobbing just a few inches above it in what might seem to
be a slightly foolish manner.
</p><p>
This is a moment for superb and delicate concentration.
</p><p>
Bob and float, float and bob.
</p><p>
Ignore all considerations of your own weight and simply let 
yourself waft higher.
</p><p>
Do not listen to what anybody says at this point because they
are unlikely to say anything helpful.  They are most likely to
say something along the lines of "Good God, you can't possibly
be flying!"  It is vitally important not to believe them or they
will suddenly be right.
</p><p>
Waft higher and higher.
</p><p>
Try a few swoops, gentle at first, then drift above the treetops
breathing regularly.
</p><p>
DO NOT WAVE AT ANYBODY.
</p><p>
When you have done this a few times you will find the moment of
distraction rapidly becomes easier and easier to achieve.
</p><p>
You will then learn all sorts of things about how to control your
flight, your speed, your maneuverability, and the trick usually lies
in not thinking too hard about whatever you want to do, but just
allowing it to happen as if it were going to anyway.
</p><p>
You will also learn how to land properly, which is something you will
almost certainly screw up, and screw up badly, on your first attempt.
</p><p>
There are private flying clubs you can join which help you achieve
the all-important moment of distraction.  They hire people with 
surprising bodies or opinions to leap out from behind bushes and
exhibit and/or explain them at the critical moments.  Few
genuine hitchhikers will be able to afford to join these clubs, but
some may be able to get temporary employment at them.
