<a name="EarthLaws.html"><h2> Laws</h2></a>
<p>
There are many interesting laws on the planet Earth. One strange law
in particular is called a "speed limit".
</p><p>
 On the planet Earth, mostly in the areas where the inhabitants wear
digital watches, there are machines called "automobiles".  These are
large plastic-metal-and-glass machines designed to move people about
with a great deal of pollution.  Although these slow-moving machines
have an average top speed of one hundred twenty miles per hour,  the
"speed limit" forces people to drive  at even slower speeds - in one
country the top speed is a mere fifty-five miles per hour.  This law
is of course, ignored by the general populace.
</p><p>
 At one time, the local constabulatory force was able to hide behind
signboards, trees, etc., with a radar to catch lawbreakers, but this
ability was taken away  because the general populace did not want to
give up their right to break the law.
