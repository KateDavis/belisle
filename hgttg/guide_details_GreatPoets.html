<p>
The Circling Poets of Arium used to live in remote mountain passes
where they would lie in wait for small bands of unwary travelers, 
circle around them, and throw rocks at them.
<p>
And when the travelers cried out, saying why didn't they go away
and get on with writing some poems instead of pestering people with
all this rock-throwing business, they would suddenly stop, and then
break into one of the seven hundred and ninety-four great Song Cycles
of Vassillian.  These songs were all of extraordinary beauty, and even 
more extraordinary length, and all fell into exactly the same pattern.
<p>
The first part of each song would tell how there once went forth from
the City of Vassillian a party of five sage princes with four horses.
The princes, who are of course brave, noble and wise, travel widely in
distant lands, fight giant ogres, pursue exotic philosophies, take tea
with weird gods and rescue beautiful monsters from ravening princesses
before finally announcing that they have achieved enlightenment and
that their wanderings are therefore accomplished.
<p>
The second, and much longer, part of each song would tell of all their
bickerings about which one of them is going to have to walk back.
<p>
All this lay in the planet's remote past.  It was, however, a descendant
of one of these eccentric poets who invented the spurious tales of
impending doom which enabled the people of Golgafrincham to rid themselves
of an entire useless third of their population.  The other two-thirds
stayed firmly at home and lived full, rich and happy lives until they
were all suddenly wiped out by a virulent disease contracted from a
dirty telephone.
