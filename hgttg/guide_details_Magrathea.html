<p>
Far back in the mists of ancient time, in the great and glorious
days of the former Galactic Empire, life was wild, rich, and
largely tax free.
<p>
Mighty starships plied their way between exotic suns, seeking
adventure and reward among the furthest reaches of Galactic space.
In those days men were real men, women were real women, and small
furry creatures from Alpha Centauri were real small furry creatures
from Alpha Centauri.  And all dared to brave unknown terrors, to do
mighty deeds, to boldly split infinitives that no man had split
before - and thus was the Empire forged.
<p>
Many men of course became extremely rich, but this was perfectly
natural and nothing to be ashamed of because no one was really
poor - at least no one worth speaking of.  And for all the richest
and most successful merchants life inevitably became rather dull
and niggly, and they began to imagine that this was therefore the
fault of the worlds they'd settled on.  None of them was entirely
satisfactory: either the climate wasn't quite right in the later
part of the afternoon, or the day was half an hour too long, or
the sea was exactly the wrong shade of pink.
<p>
And thus were created the conditions for a staggering new form of
specialist industry: custom-made luxury planet building.  The home
of this industry was Magrathea, where hyperspatial engineers sucked
matter through white holes in space to form it into dream planets -
gold planets, platinum planets, soft rubber planets with lots of 
earthquakes - all lovingly made to meet the exacting standards that
the Galaxy's richest men had naturally come to expect.
<p>
But so successful was this venture that Magrathea itself soon became
the richest planet of all time and the rest of the Galaxy was reduced
to abject poverty.  And so the system broke down, the Empire collapsed,
and a long sullen silence settled over a billion hungry worlds,
disturbed only by the pen scratchings of scholars as they labored
into the night over smug little treatises on the value of a planned
political economy.
<p>
Magrathea itself disappeared and its memory soon passed into the
obscurity of legend.
<p>
In these enlightened days, of course, no one believes a word of it.
