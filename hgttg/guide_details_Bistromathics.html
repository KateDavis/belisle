<p>
The Bistromathic drive is a wonderful new method of crossing vast
interstellar distances without all that dangerous mucking about
with Improbability factors.
<p>
Bistromathics itself is simply a revolutionary new way of understanding
the behavior of numbers.  Just as Einstein observed that
space was not an absolute but depended on the observer's movement
in space, and that time was not an absolute, but depended on the
observer's movement in time, so it is realized now that numbers are
not absolute, but depend on the observer's movement in restaurants.
<p>
The first nonabsolute number is the number of people for whom the
table is reserved.  This will vary during the course of the first
three calls to the restaurant, and then bear no apparent relation
to the number of people who actually turn up, or to the number of
people who subsequently join them after the show/match/party/gig,
or to the number of people who leave when they see who else has
turned up.
<p>
The second nonabsolute number is the given time of arrival, which
is now known to be one of those most bizarre of mathematical concepts,
a recipriversexclusion, a number whose existence can only be defined
as being anything other than itself.  In other words, the given time 
of arrival is the one moment of time at which it is impossible that
any member of the party will arrive.  Recipriversexclusions now
play a vital part in many branches of math, including statistics and
accountancy and also form the basic equations used to engineer the
Somebody Else's Problem field.
<p>
The third and most mysterious piece of nonabsoluteness of all lies
in the relationship between the number of items on the check, the
cost of each item, the number of people at the table and what they
are each prepared to pay for.  (The number of people who have actually
brought any money is only a subphenomenon in this field.)
<p>
The baffling discrepancies that used to occur at this point remained
uninvestigated for centuries simply because no one took them seriously.
They were at the time put down to such things as politeness, rudeness,
meanness, flashiness, tiredness, emotionality or the lateness of the
hour, and completely forgotten about on the following morning.  They
were never tested under laboratory conditions, of course, because
they never occurred in laboratories - not in reputable laboratories
at least.
<p>
And so it was only with the advent of pocket computers that the startling
truth became finally apparent, and it was this:
<p>
Numbers written on restaurant checks within the confines of restaurants
do not follow the same mathematical laws as numbers written on any other
pieces of paper in any other parts of the Universe.
<p>
This single statement took the scientific world by storm.  It completely
revolutionized it.  So many mathematical conferences got held in such
good restaurants that many of the finest minds of a generation died
of obesity and heart failure and the science of math was put back by
years.
<p>
Slowly, however, the implications of the idea began to be understood.
To begin with it had been too stark, too crazy, too much like what
the man in the street would have said "Oh, yes, I could have told you
that."  Then some phrases like "Interactive Subjectivity Frameworks"
were invented, and everybody was able to relax and get on with it.
<p>
The small groups of monks who had taken up hanging around the major
research institutes singing strange chants to the effect that the
Universe was only a figment of its own imagination were eventually
given a street theater grant and went away.
