<p>
Disaster Area, a plutonium rock band from the Gagrakacka Mind Zones,
are generally held to be not only the loudest rock band in the Galaxy,
but in fact the loudest noise of any kind at all.  Regular concert
goers judge that the best sound balance is usually to be heard from
within large concrete bunkers some thirty-seven miles from the stage,
while the musicians themselves play their instruments by remote
control from within a heavily insulated spaceship which stays in
orbit around the planet - or more frequently around a completely
different planet.
<p>
Their songs are on the whole very simple and mostly follow the familiar
theme of boy-being meets girl-being under a silvery moon which then
explodes for no adequately explored reason.
<p>
Many worlds have now banned their act altogether, sometimes for
artistic reasons, but most commonly because the band's public address
system contravenes local strategic arms limitations treaties.
<p>
This has not, however, stopped their earnings from pushing back the
boundaries of pure hypermathematics, and their chief research accountant
has recently been appointed Professor of Neomathematics at the 
University of Maximegalon, in recognition of both his General and
his Special Theories of Disaster Area Tax returns, in which he
proves that the whole fabric of the space-time continuum is not
merely curved, it is in fact totally bent.
