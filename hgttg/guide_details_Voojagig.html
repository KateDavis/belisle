Veet Voojagig, a quiet young student at the University of Maximegalon,
who pursued a brilliant academic career studying ancient philology,
transformational ethics and the wave harmonic theory of historical
perception, and then, after a night of drinking 
<a href="guide_details_GargleBlaster.html">Pan Galactic Gargle Blasters</a>
with Zaphod Beeblebrox, became increasingly obsessed with
the problem of what had happened to all the ballpoints he'd bought
over the past few years.
<p>
There followed a long period of painstaking research during which he
visited all the major centers of ballpoint loss throughout the Galaxy
and eventually came up with a quaint little theory which quite caught
the public imagination at the time.  Somewhere in the cosmos, he said,
along with all the planets inhabited by humanoids, reptiloids, fishoids,
walking treeoids, and superintelligent shades of the color blue, there
was also a planet given over entirely to ballpoint life forms.  And
it was to this planet that unattended ballpoints would make their way,
slipping away quietly through wormholes in space to a world where they
knew they could enjoy a uniquely ballpointoid life-style, responding
to highly ballpoint-oriented life-style, and generally leading the
ballpoint equivalent of the good life.
<p>
And as theories go this was all very fine and pleasant until Veet
Voojagig suddenly claimed to have FOUND this planet, and to have worked
there for a while driving a limousine for a family of cheap green 
retractibles, whereupon he was taken away, locked up, wrote a book
and was finally sent into tax exile, which is the fate usually reserved
for those who are determined to make fools of themselves in public.
<p>
When one day an expedition was sent to the spatial coordinates that
Voojagig had claimed for this planet they discovered only a small
asteroid inhabited by a solitary old man who claimed that nothing
was true, though he was later discovered to be lying.
<p>
There did, however, remain the question of both the mysterious sixty
thousand Altairian dollars paid yearly into his Brantisvogan bank
account, and of course Zaphod Beeblebrox's highly profitable
secondhand ballpoint business.
